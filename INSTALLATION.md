This guide covers installation, validation, upgrade, recovery, and removal of
**VBA Probability Distributions**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> VBA source can execute with the user's Office permissions. Review the exact
> source or use a trusted tagged release, follow the organization's macro
> security policy, and never enable macros in an untrusted workbook.

## 🧭 Support baseline

| Item | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Host | Desktop Microsoft Excel with VBA |
| Office bitness | Use only environments actually validated by the release |
| Version identity | Root `VERSION` file and the selected tag/commit |
| Source policy | Exported repository source is authoritative |
| Licence | MIT |
| Current deployment status | Source-first numerical library; no external numerical runtime is required for normal use. |

Compatibility claims apply only to environments actually certified for the
selected release. Read [README.md](README.md), [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md), and
the release notes before installation.

## 🎯 Deployment model

The VBA regression suite is a fast contract gate; the external benchmark is the high-precision accuracy authority. Passing one does not replace the other.

Choose one supported model and keep its source identity explicit:

| Model | Use when | Trust boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Embedded source | The component must travel with a workbook or add-in | Destination project contains the reviewed source |
| Tagged source | You build or integrate the component yourself | Tag/commit and exported files define identity |
| Published binary | The project explicitly ships a workbook/add-in asset | Hash, tag binding, and package smoke evidence are required |
| Development source | Focused testing or contribution work | Not a supported release unless the project says otherwise |

Do not combine files from different tags, commits, release assets, local exports,
or copied workbooks.

---

## 📂 Production source package

| Order | Repository source | VBE component | Responsibility |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 1 | `src/M_STATS_PROBDIST_CORE.bas` | `M_STATS_PROBDIST_CORE` | Shared constants, predicates, guarded arithmetic, and diagnostics |
| 2 | `src/M_STATS_PROBDIST_SPECIALFUNCS.bas` | `M_STATS_PROBDIST_SPECIALFUNCS` | Gamma/beta functions, series, fractions, and inverse kernels |
| 3 | remaining `src/M_STATS_PROBDIST_*.bas` files | matching family modules | Worksheet-visible distribution functions |

Optional material is not part of the normal runtime unless stated otherwise:

| Source | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `tests/M_STATS_PROBDIST_TEST.bas` | Fast deterministic VBA regression and contract tests |
| `benchmark/` | External high-precision evidence tooling; not required at runtime |

> [!CAUTION]
> A `.frm` and its `.frx` companion are one logical component. Keep them in
> the same directory during import, never import the `.frx` separately, and
> never process it as text.

---

## 🚀 Fresh installation

1. Back up the macro-enabled destination workbook.
2. Import CORE, then SPECIALFUNCS, then every distribution-family module from the same source revision.
3. Compile the complete VBA project.
4. Call representative density, cumulative, survival, inverse, moment, and diagnostic functions.
5. If validating source, import the matching test module and run the complete regression harness.

### VBE import procedure

1. Open the destination workbook or add-in and press `Alt+F11`.
2. Select the intended project in Project Explorer.
3. Use **File → Import File…** for exported modules, classes, and forms.
4. Confirm component names match the repository source.
5. Run **Debug → Compile VBAProject**.
6. Save in a macro-capable format such as `.xlsm`, `.xlsb`, or `.xlam`
   when the project requires executable VBA.
7. Close and reopen the host before the clean-session smoke test.

Do not paste source into arbitrarily named modules when an exported component is
available. VBE attributes, component identity, form resources, and line endings
are part of a reproducible source installation.

## ✅ Validation

A successful import is not sufficient evidence that the installation is correct.

- Run the affected family runner and `Test_STATS_PROBDIST_RunAll`.
- Verify central, support-boundary, invalid-domain, tail, inverse, overflow/underflow, and error-code behavior as applicable.
- For numerical changes, run the external accuracy contracts against independent high-precision references.
- Confirm expected values were not produced by the implementation under test.
- Record exact SHA, Excel/Office environment, reference versions, tolerances, worst discrepancy, and limitations.

### Minimum installation evidence

~~~text
Source tag or full commit SHA:
VERSION:
Files imported:
Excel version/build:
Office bitness:
Operating system:
Compile:
Consumer smoke:
Regression/certification:
Cleanup:
Skipped or unverified:
~~~

Treat a skipped, incomplete, cleanup-failed, or wrong-environment run as not
certified. Static checks and source review do not replace execution in Excel.

## ⬆️ Upgrade

Before upgrading:

1. read the complete version-to-version changelog;
2. back up the host and export any local modifications;
3. stop or clean up active component state;
4. identify every required production component;
5. decide whether stored configuration or generated assets are compatible.

- Replace the complete numerical foundation and all affected family modules together.
- Do not combine kernels and wrappers from different commits or releases.
- Review parameterization, error mapping, convergence, and accuracy-contract changes.
- Re-run VBA regression and the external accuracy gate before claiming numerical equivalence.

After replacement, compile and repeat the full installation validation. Do not
claim an upgrade is non-breaking solely because VBA signatures compile.

### Local modifications

A locally modified copy is a fork. Diff it against the old and new exported
source, reapply changes deliberately, and retest. Do not overwrite it and assume
the local behavior survived.

## 🧯 Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Check |
|---|---|
| Compile error or missing procedure | Confirm every required component was imported from one version and optional dependencies are present. |
| Ambiguous name | Remove duplicate/legacy modules; do not paste new source beside old components. |
| Form missing controls or corrupt UI | Re-import the `.frm` with its exact adjacent `.frx`. |
| Behavior differs by workbook | Check caller, active-object, settings namespace, references, locale, and date-system assumptions. |
| 32/64-bit failure | Confirm the tested Office bitness and conditional WinAPI declarations. |
| Excel left altered after failure | Run the documented recovery/cleanup path; do not blindly force global state. |
| Security warning | Verify source origin, signature/hash where provided, trusted location policy, and macro settings. |
| Output differs from reference | Confirm exact version, inputs, parameterization, tolerance, environment, and reference independence. |

If recovery is uncertain, save user data separately, close Excel, reopen a clean
session, and reproduce with a minimal sanitized workbook before changing code.

## 🗑️ Removal

1. Remove all imported distribution-family, special-function, core, and optional test modules.
2. Compile the remaining VBA project and remove worksheet formulas that still call the deleted functions.

Removing files does not automatically remove workbook formulas, Ribbon XML,
registry settings, trusted-location configuration, cached add-ins, shortcuts,
scheduled callbacks, or other integrations. Remove only state the component
owns and document anything intentionally retained.

---

## 🔐 Security and privacy

- Obtain source and assets from the official repository or a verified release.
- Compare the selected tag, `VERSION`, release notes, and any published hash.
- Review VBA before enabling macros.
- Do not test with client, personal, regulated, or confidential workbooks.
- Inspect example and release workbooks for links, connections, names,
  properties, hidden content, and embedded code.
- Follow organizational macro, add-in, trusted-location, and signing policy.
- Report vulnerabilities through [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md), not publicly.

### Installation principle

> Install one identifiable source version, compile it, exercise its real host
> behavior, and keep evidence of what was—and was not—validated.
