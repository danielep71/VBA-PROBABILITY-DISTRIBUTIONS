Thank you for helping improve **VBA Probability Distributions**.

Contributions are welcome when they strengthen correctness, clarity,
maintainability, compatibility, documentation, tests, or reproducibility. The
standard is not simply that a change works once: another person must be able to
review it, reproduce the evidence, and understand its operational boundaries.

Participation is governed by the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
Report suspected vulnerabilities privately under [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md);
never disclose sensitive details in a public issue or pull request.

## 🧭 Start here

Before opening work:

1. Read the README, this guide, the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md),
   [Security Policy](SECURITY.md), and [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).
2. Search open and closed issues and pull requests for related work.
3. Open an issue before a non-trivial feature, public-API change, dependency,
   architectural change, compatibility break, or broad refactor.
4. Agree the observable contract and validation approach before implementation.
5. Keep credentials, personal/client data, proprietary workbooks, and restricted
   reference material out of the repository.

Small documentation corrections and narrowly obvious fixes may go directly to a
focused pull request.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Numerical equivalence that looks obvious must still be measured. VBA does not
> short-circuit And or Or, and an assignment used to force a Double rounding
> boundary may be correctness-critical.

## 🌱 Ways to contribute

| Contribution | Good first action |
|---|---|
| 🐛 Reproducible defect | Open an issue with minimal inputs, expected behavior, observed behavior, and environment. |
| ✨ Feature or API change | Open an issue describing users, contract, alternatives, compatibility, and validation. |
| 🧪 Tests or reference evidence | Explain provenance, independence, precision, coverage, and expected failure detection. |
| 📖 Documentation | Identify the affected behavior and keep examples executable and current. |
| ⚙️ Repository/tooling | Explain developer impact, failure behavior, portability, and maintenance cost. |
| 🔐 Security concern | Follow [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md); do not open a public report. |
| 💬 Usage question | Use the repository's supported discussion or issue channel without sensitive data. |

A proposal may be adapted, deferred, or declined when it is out of scope,
duplicates an existing capability, weakens a contract, or creates maintenance
cost disproportionate to its benefit.

## 📁 Repository model

This is a **source-first numerical library**. The Git diff, not an opaque workbook, is
the review artifact.

| Location | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `src/` | Authoritative exported distribution and numerical-kernel modules |
| `tests/` | Fast deterministic VBA regression and contract tests |
| `benchmark/` | High-precision external accuracy gate and evidence |
| `docs/` and wiki | API, architecture, accuracy, and diagnostics |
| `tools/` | Manifest, error computation, and source validation |

The README and current tree are authoritative if a listed optional directory is
not present.

## 🌿 Development workflow

1. Fork or clone the repository and start from the current `main`.
2. Create a short, focused branch such as `fix/clear-description`,
   `feat/clear-description`, `docs/clear-description`, or
   `test/clear-description`.
3. Reproduce the existing behavior before changing it.
4. Define the intended contract, affected callers, compatibility impact, and
   evidence plan.
5. Make the smallest coherent source change; do not mix unrelated formatting,
   refactoring, generated files, or cleanup.
6. Compile and run the relevant static, regression, host, and manual checks.
7. Re-export changed VBA components and review the complete text/binary diff.
8. Update documentation and release notes required by the change.
9. Push the branch and open a pull request with evidence and limitations.

Repository maintainers may use the repository's configured direct-push workflow
where permitted. External contributions and reviewable portfolio changes should
use branches and pull requests.

### Commit discipline

Write imperative, specific subjects, normally in this form:

```text
fix: preserve formulas during write-back
feat: add explicit tail calculation
test: cover cleanup after initialization failure
docs: clarify supported Office environments
chore: harden repository validation
```

Keep commits reviewable. Reference the issue when one exists. Do not include
secrets, private links, generated attribution boilerplate, or unverifiable test
claims in commit messages.

## 📦 Source-first VBA

Exported source is authoritative.

- Use `Option Explicit`.
- Preserve the repository's VBE export metadata, module names, encoding, and
  line-ending policy.
- Match `.bas`, `.cls`, and `.frm` filenames to their component identity.
- Keep every required `.frm` / `.frx` pair together; treat `.frx` as binary.
- Do not edit a binary form resource as text.
- Do not use a workbook or add-in as the only record of a code change.
- Do not commit Office lock files, recovery copies, local exports, test output,
  or generated binaries unless the repository explicitly designates them as
  source.
- Qualify workbook, worksheet, range, and application references.
- Avoid implicit active-workbook, active-sheet, selection, and default-member
  dependencies.
- Keep `On Error Resume Next` scopes narrow and intentional.
- Preserve useful diagnostic context and clean up on success and failure.
- Avoid new references, APIs, dependencies, or platform assumptions until their
  support and deployment impact is agreed.

### Public contracts and compatibility

Treat documented procedures, functions, classes, enums, parameters, defaults,
return values, errors, side effects, workbook formats, and supported platforms
as contracts.

A contract-changing contribution must:

1. identify affected callers and migration needs;
2. explain what changes and what remains unchanged;
3. add or update regression coverage;
4. update user-facing documentation and examples; and
5. state whether the release impact is patch, minor, or major.

Do not make an internal helper public merely to simplify a test. Use an explicit
test seam where the project supports one.

### Excel state ownership

Assume these surfaces belong to the caller or host unless the project explicitly
owns them:

```text
Application.Calculation
Application.EnableEvents
Application.ScreenUpdating
Application.DisplayAlerts
Application.StatusBar
active workbook / worksheet / selection
window styles, shortcuts, timers, names, links, connections, and shapes
```

Capture state before changing it. Restore only state the component successfully
changed and still owns. Cleanup must not conceal the original failure.

## 🧩 Project engineering contract

| Area | Required behavior |
|---|---|
| **Parameterization** | State distribution parameterization, support, units, cumulative/tail convention, and worksheet error behavior. |
| **Numerical kernels** | Preserve guarded arithmetic, cancellation-safe forms, convergence limits, and forced binary64 rounding boundaries where load-bearing. |
| **Independent evidence** | Expected values must come from an independent implementation or authoritative source, never the VBA path under test. |
| **Reachability** | Predict affected public callers and movement before changing a shared kernel; compare prediction with measured movement. |
| **Public errors** | Preserve the documented `#NUM!` / `#VALUE!`, underflow, non-convergence, and optional status contracts. |
| **Module identity** | Keep one file per module and match each `.bas` filename to `Attribute VB_Name`. |

<a id="validation-and-evidence"></a>

## 🧪 Validation and evidence

Validation must be proportional to risk and reproducible from the exact source
under review.

- Compile the complete VBA project.
- Run the affected family suite and `Test_STATS_PROBDIST_RunAll`.
- Run the external benchmark and its accuracy contracts for numerical changes.
- Test central, boundary, tail, invalid-domain, underflow/overflow, inverse, and round-trip behavior as applicable.
- Record exact commit, Excel/Office bitness, reference system/version/precision, tested points, tolerance, worst observed error, and failures.

When source changes, regenerate evidence in this order: export Excel observations; write the manifest; compute the accuracy summary; then commit source, grid, manifest, and summary together. Never rebind old measurements to new code.

### Evidence principles

- Test the behavior, not only the implementation path.
- Add a permanent regression for every corrected defect.
- Include ordinary, boundary, invalid-input, error, and cleanup paths.
- Use an independent source for expected numerical results.
- State skips and unavailable environments explicitly; a skipped check is not a
  pass.
- Do not claim compatibility, accuracy, performance, or certification beyond
  what was actually observed.
- Treat cleanup failures and incomplete runs as failures.
- Never generate expected values with the implementation under test.

### Suggested evidence block

```text

Commit / tag:
Files or components changed:

Environment
-----------
Excel:
Office bitness:
Operating system:
Locale / date system:
Deployment or host:

## 📖 Documentation and release notes

Update the README and affected wiki pages for public functions, architecture, numerical accuracy, kernels, diagnostics, and testing. Keep examples and parameter descriptions synchronized.

Documentation must say:

- what users can rely on;
- inputs, outputs, defaults, side effects, and failure behavior;
- supported and untested environments;
- installation or migration steps;
- numerical or platform assumptions; and
- any known limitation introduced or exposed by the change.

Do not edit a released version or tag merely to describe unreleased work. Release
numbers, artifacts, hashes, and dates belong to the repository's release
workflow.

---

## 🔐 Security, privacy, and provenance

- Follow [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for vulnerability reports.
- Use synthetic, anonymized, or explicitly redistributable examples and data.
- Remove names, email addresses, account identifiers, workbook properties,
  document metadata, credentials, tokens, private URLs, and machine-specific
  paths.
- Verify the license and redistribution rights of copied code, formulas,
  reference tables, images, and generated material.
- Cite material algorithms and external reference data precisely enough for a
  reviewer to verify them.
- You remain responsible for the correctness, licensing, security, and
  reviewability of tool-assisted contributions.
