**VBA-PROBABILITY-DISTRIBUTIONS** is a local Excel/VBA numerical library. Its expected calculation runtime does not require networking, a credential store, a background service, or automatic updates.

This policy explains which versions receive security attention, how to report a
suspected vulnerability privately, what the project considers security-relevant,
and which trust boundaries remain the responsibility of users and host
organizations.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A security policy does not make macros, workbooks, add-ins, source archives, or
> release artifacts inherently trustworthy. Establish provenance and apply your
> organization's security controls before enabling executable content.

<a id="security-model"></a>

## 🧭 Security model

The project assumes that:

- Microsoft Excel, the operating system, and the VBA runtime are trusted;
- the current user is authorized to open and run the workbook or add-in;
- macros are enabled only through an approved trust mechanism;
- project source or artifacts were obtained from an official channel; and
- the host workbook and other code already trusted in the Excel process are not
  malicious.

These are trust boundaries, not guarantees. VBA projects running in the same
Excel process are not isolated security sandboxes.

A wrong density, probability, quantile, moment, error classification, or tolerance result is normally an ordinary correctness defect. It becomes security-sensitive when deliberately exploitable to defeat a material validation, integrity, authorization, or availability control.

<a id="supported-versions"></a>

## 📦 Supported versions

| Source state | Security support |
|---|---|
| **Latest tagged functional release** | ✅ Supported |
| **Release candidate before publication** | ⚠️ Testing and best-effort remediation |
| **main** | ⚠️ Development code; best effort |
| **Older tagged releases** | ❌ Normally unsupported; upgrade first |
| **Modified copies, unofficial forks, or mirrors** | ❌ Unsupported unless the issue reproduces in official supported source |

If the project has not yet published a functional release, development code is
pre-release and no production version is security-supported.

Security fixes normally land on **main** and are included in a new tagged
release. Older releases are not normally patched in place unless the maintainer
states otherwise.

Reports must identify an exact release tag or full commit SHA. Descriptions such
as “latest” or “yesterday's main” are insufficient because branches change.

<a id="reporting-a-vulnerability"></a>

## 📣 Reporting a vulnerability

Do **not** disclose a suspected vulnerability in a public issue, discussion,
pull request, commit message, Wiki page, sample workbook, screenshot, or release
thread.

Use either private channel:

1. On the repository **Security** page, select **Report a vulnerability** when
   GitHub private vulnerability reporting is available.
2. Otherwise email **danielep71@gmail.com** with the subject:
   **Private security report — VBA-PROBABILITY-DISTRIBUTIONS**.

Include the smallest amount of information needed to reproduce and assess the
issue:

| Evidence | Requested detail |
|---|---|
| 🧾 **Identity** | Repository, exact tag or full commit SHA, file, module, procedure, and artifact |
| 🖥️ **Environment** | Excel version/build, Office bitness, Windows version, locale, and deployment model |
| 🎯 **Impact** | Confidentiality, integrity, availability, code-execution, or supply-chain consequence |
| 🔬 **Reproduction** | Minimal steps and proof using synthetic data |
| 🧨 **Exploitability** | Preconditions, required trust, user interaction, affected scope, and persistence |
| 🛡️ **Mitigation** | Workaround or containment already tested, if any |
| 📎 **Evidence** | Sanitized logs, diagnostics, screenshots, hashes, or proof of concept |
| 📐 **Numerical contract** | Distribution, function, parameters, domain, tail, expected error behavior, tolerance, and independent reference |
| 🔢 **Failure regime** | Central/extreme inputs, convergence, recursion/iteration bound, underflow/overflow, resource use, and termination state |
| 🧬 **Evidence provenance** | Source commit and origin/precision of grids, holdouts, reference values, regression results, and release artifacts |

Do not send real client, employer, counterparty, student, production, or personal
workbooks. Remove credentials, tokens, personal data, internal paths,
connections, external links, document metadata, hidden names, cached values,
queries, and other unrelated content.

If a secret has been exposed, revoke or rotate it immediately before spending
time perfecting the report.

<a id="response-process"></a>

## ⏱️ Response process

This project is maintained by one person. Response times are best-effort rather than a contractual SLA.

The maintainer aims to:

| Stage | Target |
|---|---|
| **Acknowledgement** | Within 5 business days |
| **Initial scope and severity assessment** | Within 10 business days after sufficient evidence is available |
| **Progress update for an active investigation** | At least every 14 days |
| **Remediation and disclosure** | Proportionate to severity, exploitability, affected users, and validation needs |

The process normally includes reproducing the issue, determining affected
versions and artifacts, containing active risk, developing a fix, adding
regression or fault-injection evidence, validating in the relevant Excel and
Windows environment, and preparing a corrected release or advisory.

Targets may change when reproduction requires unavailable Office versions,
hardware, long-running behavior, third-party coordination, or sanitized evidence
from the reporter. Material delays will be communicated when practical.

Reporter credit can be included in an advisory or release notes when requested.
Anonymous credit is also acceptable.

<a id="security-triage"></a>

## 🎯 Security issue or ordinary defect?

When uncertain, report privately. The maintainer can reclassify a report safely.

Security reports include credible risks of:

- unintended code execution or crossing a documented trust boundary;
- unauthorized reading, modification, deletion, or disclosure of data;
- persistent or exploitable loss of availability;
- credential, token, signing-key, runner, or automation compromise;
- malicious, substituted, or misleading official release artifacts;
- validation or provenance bypasses that can represent an unsafe artifact as
  trusted; or
- a correctness defect deliberately exploitable to defeat a security,
  authorization, integrity, or control boundary.

An incorrect result, compatibility problem, bounded performance regression,
documentation error, or recoverable UI defect is normally an ordinary bug unless
it creates a concrete security impact.

### Severity guide

| Severity | Typical impact |
|---|---|
| **Critical** | Unintended code execution, exposed release credentials, compromised official artifacts, or broad unauthorized data access |
| **High** | Significant integrity/confidentiality loss, persistent host compromise, or practical supply-chain exploitation |
| **Moderate** | Bounded availability or integrity impact requiring meaningful preconditions |
| **Low** | Hardening weakness or limited impact without demonstrated exploitation |

Severity considers impact, exploitability, required privileges, user
interaction, affected versions, recoverability, and whether trusted malicious
VBA is already required.

<a id="security-scope"></a>

## 🛠️ Security scope

### In scope

- official source and committed executable or macro-enabled artifacts;
- official GitHub Release assets, archives, checksums, manifests, and provenance
  claims;
- repository-owned build, test, validation, packaging, and release tooling;
- GitHub Actions workflows, permissions, dependencies, and project-managed
  credentials;
- documented runtime integrations and trust boundaries; and
- security or integrity behavior introduced by this project's code.

### Project-specific risk surfaces

- **Unexpected execution or mutation** — behavior outside documented calculation results and caller-authorized workbook interaction.
- **Resource exhaustion** — crafted inputs causing effectively non-terminating loops, unbounded recursion, persistent hangs, or uncontrolled memory use.
- **Numerical control bypass** — exploitable tail, quantile, convergence, or error-handling defects that defeat a material integrity check.
- **Evidence integrity** — altered grids, holdouts, tolerances, references, provenance, or regression artifacts represented as valid.
- **Supply chain** — substituted modules, tampered workbooks/archives, compromised workflows, or misleading release claims.

### Out of scope

- vulnerabilities in Microsoft Excel, Office, Windows, GitHub, Python, or the
  VBA runtime themselves;
- organization-controlled macro security, endpoint controls, access rights, or
  deployment policy;
- malicious VBA already trusted and running in the same Excel process;
- unrelated workbooks, add-ins, dependencies, or infrastructure;
- modified copies that do not reproduce the issue in official supported source;
- unofficial mirrors, repackaged binaries, or unsupported historical snapshots;
- lost or stolen user credentials not exposed by this project;
- social engineering unrelated to official project content; and
- ordinary defects without a concrete security impact.

Upstream vulnerabilities should be reported to the responsible vendor or
platform.

<a id="data-and-secrets"></a>

## 🔐 Data and secret handling

Never commit, upload, log, or attach:

- passwords, personal access tokens, API keys, signing keys, certificates, or
  connection strings;
- client, employer, counterparty, student, employee, or personal data;
- proprietary source, models, workbooks, market data, production extracts, or
  licensed vendor content;
- internal URLs, machine-specific paths, environment dumps, or unredacted
  screenshots; or
- proof-of-concept material beyond what is necessary to establish the issue.

Use synthetic data and a minimal reproduction. Excel files can carry sensitive
material outside visible cells, including document properties, defined names,
hidden sheets, VBA, cached values, Power Query data, external links, and
connections.

Repository secrets must be scoped to the smallest necessary workflow, protected
from untrusted pull-request code, excluded from logs and artifacts, and rotated
after suspected exposure.

---

<a id="supply-chain"></a>

## 📦 Supply-chain and release integrity

Trusted distribution is limited to the official repository and its GitHub
Releases page.

Maintainers should:

- review executable and macro-enabled artifacts before publication;
- pin third-party workflow actions to immutable commit SHAs;
- grant workflows the minimum required permissions;
- keep build, validation, signing, and publication responsibilities separated
  where practical;
- publish checksums, manifests, attestations, or signatures when the release
  process supports them; and
- document exactly what each piece of release evidence proves.

A checksum proves file identity. It does not prove that the file is safe, that
it was built from the stated source, or that it executed successfully in Excel.

Source hashes, artifact hashes, source-to-artifact provenance, Excel execution
evidence, and signing identity are distinct claims and must not be conflated.

---

<a id="automation"></a>

## 🤖 Repository automation and runners

Workflow code and configuration are security-sensitive.

- Do not expose secrets to pull requests from forks or other untrusted code.
- Do not run untrusted contributions on a persistent self-hosted Excel/Windows
  runner with repository, user, network, or signing credentials.
- Use ephemeral or isolated runners where practical.
- Clean workbooks, temporary files, Excel processes, credentials, and workspace
  state between jobs.
- Treat logs, screenshots, workbooks, test artifacts, and environment metadata
  as potentially sensitive.
- Review changes to workflow permissions, action pins, release jobs, dependency
  acquisition, and artifact upload/download paths as security changes.

Automation that writes repository content or publishes releases must have
explicit, least-privilege authorization.

---

<a id="safe-use"></a>

## ✅ Safe-use guidance

Users should:

- obtain source only from the official repository or a tagged release and record the exact tag or commit;
- review plain-text VBA before importing it and preserve organization-approved macro security;
- compile and run the documented regression and accuracy checks in a controlled workbook;
- use bounded inputs and independent high-precision references for material numerical validation;
- do not treat an unreviewed development snapshot as a stable release; and
- sanitize inputs, outputs, workbooks, diagnostics, and generated evidence before sharing.

No numerical, statistical, pricing, timing, or UI result from this project is by
itself an authentication, authorization, access-control, cryptographic,
financial-advice, or safety-critical mechanism.

---

<a id="coordinated-disclosure"></a>

## 📣 Coordinated disclosure

Avoid public disclosure while exploitability is being assessed, a fix is being
prepared, affected users have not had reasonable time to update, an exposed
secret remains valid, or a malicious artifact or runner remains reachable.

The maintainer and reporter should agree a disclosure plan based on severity,
active exploitation, remediation complexity, availability of a workaround, and
the time needed to validate a corrected release.

The maintainer may ask for a sanitized reproduction, additional environment
detail, confirmation against a candidate fix, or a reasonable embargo. The
reporter does not surrender ownership of their research.

When remediation is available, the project may publish a GitHub Security
Advisory, corrected release, release-note entry, mitigation guidance, and credit
agreed with the reporter.

<a id="safe-harbor"></a>

## 🛡️ Good-faith research and safe harbor

Good-faith security research is welcome when it:

- stays within this project's source, artifacts, and documented integrations;
- avoids privacy violations, data destruction, service disruption, persistence,
  social engineering, and access to data beyond what is necessary;
- stops after establishing the minimum evidence required;
- reports the issue privately and promptly; and
- allows reasonable time for investigation and remediation.

The project will not initiate or recommend legal action solely for research
conducted in good faith and consistently with this policy. This statement does
not authorize testing of third-party systems or bind Microsoft, GitHub, an
employer, a client, or any other third party.

No paid bug bounty is offered unless the maintainer states otherwise in writing.
